# Viewing live camera images over SSH 
:toc:
:toclevels: 5

## Background
If you are using Raspbian Lite, which does not come with a GUI, you may struggle to determine what images the camera is capturing. Viewing a live feed of the camera is useful for debugging.

## Setup
Viewing the live feed of camera images over SSH requires installation of https://www.xquartz.org/[XQuartz] on macOS. 
....
brew install --cask xquartz
....

## Viewing live feed
1. Open XQuartz
1. In an XQuartz terminal: `ssh -v -XY <user>@<pi hostname or IP>`
1. Stop the service, if it's running, so that we don't have two copies of the program running: `sudo systemctl stop scaredycat_main.service`
1. Run the program with the preview flag: `./bin/scaredycat --show-preview`

## Known issues

This method of viewing live camera images doesn't seem to work with `sudo`. It fails when running in XQuartz with https://gist.github.com/dasl-/35a7a9df94a35188e2307b6e6e2fa092[this error]. So don't run with `sudo`!
