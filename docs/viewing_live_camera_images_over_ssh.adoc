:toclevels: 5

## Background
If you are using Raspbian Lite, which does not come with a GUI, you may struggle to determine what images the camera is capturing. Viewing a live feed of the camera is useful for debugging.

## Setup
Viewing the live feed of camera images over SSH requires installation of https://www.xquartz.org/[XQuartz] on macOS. 
....
brew install --cask xquartz
....

## Viewing live feed
1. Open XQuartz
1. In an XQuartz terminal: `ssh -v -XY <user>@<pi hostname or IP>`
1. ...etc...
